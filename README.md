# Python OOP
## Four Pillars of OOP

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Encapsulation
The definition of encapsulation is "the action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule".
Hence, removing access to parts of your code and making things private is exactly what Encapsulation is all about 
### Abstraction

### Inheritance 

### Polymorphism

### Functions 
**Functions** are a block of reusable code that can preform a specific tasks without repeating.

DRY **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself

Input:
```python
def greeting():
    print("Welcome on Board!")
greeting() 
```
Output:
```python
Welcome on Board!
```
