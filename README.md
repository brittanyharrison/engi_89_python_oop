# Python OOP
## Four Pillars of OOP

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is accomplished when each object maintains a private state, inside a class. Other objects can not access this state directly, instead, they can only invoke a list of public functions. 
### Abstraction
Abstraction is an extension of encapsulation. It is the process of selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the object. Suppose you want to create a dating application and you are asked to collect all the information about your users. 
### Inheritance 
Inheritance is the ability of one object to acquire some/all properties of another object. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, reusability is a major advantage.
### Polymorphism
Polymorphism gives us a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there is no confusion with mixing types. 
### Functions 
**Functions** are a block of reusable code that can preform a specific tasks without repeating.

DRY **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself

Input:
```python
def greeting():
    print("Welcome on Board!")
greeting() 
```
Output:
```python
Welcome on Board!
```
